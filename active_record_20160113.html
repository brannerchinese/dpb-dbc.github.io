 1. Two Other Small Points
---

### Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
--


A mapping means a correspondence — one thing corresponds, item-by-item, to another.
--


In this case we are talking about Ruby classes ("object") and database tables ("relations").
--


This is a wrapper that allows you to write Ruby and have SQL written for you, so you don't have to interact directly with the database.
--


It allows you to change the database software you use, without having to change your code — the ORM handles any "dialect"-changes to SQL.
--


The principal ORM in use with Ruby is Active Record. The theory ("Active Record Pattern") goes back to 2003; the Ruby library is called `ActiveRecord`.

### Basic Structure of an ActiveRecord Project, cont'd


We are in **MVC territory**: the **`app`** directory contains separate subdirectories for each of those types of class. 

```tree
├── app
│   ├── controllers
│   ├── models
│   └── views
```
--


**`spec`**: notice that we are preparing mainly for tests of `model` classes:

```tree
└── spec
    ├── models
    └── spec_helper.rb
```
--

There is an RSpec configuration file `spec_helper.rb` which sets "fixtures" to be run before and after each test. 
--
Fixtures often serve to ensure test-independence.
--


<!-- -->**`config`**: project-wide configuration files, usually provided for you

```tree
├── config
│   └── environment.rb
```

---

### Basic Structure of an ActiveRecord Project, cont'd



**`lib`**: utility programs go here
--
 — for instance, a program to load data from a file into the database
--

```tree
├── lib
│   └── sunlight_legislators_importer.rb
```
--


**`db`**: Three parts:

```tree
├── db
│   ├── data
│   │   └── legislators.csv
│   ├── migrate
│   └── seeds.rb
```
--

 * `data`: subdirectory where data files may go
--


 * `seeds.rb`: a program to get starting data into the datavase
--


 * `migrate`: subdirectory containing "migration" files
--
 — a migration file is a Ruby program to "migrate" (update) a database.
--


   Migration means modifying a schema — including adding, modifying, or dropping tables. 
--
`db` may also contain databases for the project. 
---

### Digression: What is a Migration File Made Of?
--


Here is a sample migration file, `20150713103800_create_people.rb`, from one of the challenges: 

```ruby
class CreatePeople < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :people do |t|
      t.string :first_name
      t.string :last_name

      t.timestamps(null: false)
    end
  end
end
```
--

 * it is an actual Ruby program
--


 * filename starts with timestamp: `20150713103800` = Jul 13, 2015, 10:38 a.m.
--


 * filename contains snake-case version (`create_table`) of camel-case class name (`CreatePeople`)
--
 — this is a requirement
--


 * class inherits from the class `Migration` in the `ActiveRecord` module (we know it's a module because we use `::` with it)
--


 * all our classes will contain a `change` method; they may contain others
---

### Digression: What is a Migration File Made Of? (…)

```ruby
class CreatePeople < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :people do |t|
      t.string :first_name
      t.string :last_name

      t.timestamps(null: false)
    end
  end
end
```
--

 * Within method `change` we have a "definition" called `create_table`. 
--
You can see all the available definitions [in the docs](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html#using-the-change-method).
--


 * Here, `create_table` creates a table named `people`, using a `do` loop to iterate through each field (column). 
--


   By convention, we use the dummy variable `t` as the variable, which is supposed to suggest "table"
--
 — even though we are only dealing with the unique fields of a single table, so iteration is a somewhat misleading name for what we are doing.
---

### Digression: What is a Migration File Made Of? (…)

```ruby
class CreatePeople < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :people do |t|
      t.string :first_name
      t.string :last_name

      t.timestamps(null: false)
    end
  end
end
```
--

Within the `create_table` definition we are defining three fields:
--


   * `first_name`, which the database needs to know is a string
--
 (notice that ActiveRecord wants a symbol for the table-name)
--


   * `last_name`, another string
--

   * `timestamps`, which ActiveRecord will unpack into
--


     * `created_at`
--

     * `updated_at`
--

     and populated for us with the current system time.
---

### Digression: What is a Migration File Made Of? (…)

```ruby
class CreatePeople < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :people do |t|
      t.string :first_name
      t.string :last_name

      t.timestamps(null: false)
    end
  end
end
```
--

The timestamps are both passed a hash as argument, which ActiveRecord will tell the database means `NOT NULL` in SQL. 
--


These timestamps can then never be left blank.
--


`null: false` can be used with other fields, as well, as we choose.
--


Note that Ruby relationships are defined in models, not in migrations — they are called "associations" and we'll deal with them later.
--





Take some time and read up about the available definitions [in the docs](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html#using-the-change-method).

**Rakefile**: 
--
a script containing namespace- and class-definitions for use by `rake` at the command line.
--


(`rake` means: `make` for Ruby — `make` is a scripting tool for compiling and building software projects).
--


It's instructive to open a Rakefile and look at what's inside of it.
--


You'll see that it defines commands that we can use with `rake` when we call `rake` at the command line.

### Basic Structure of an ActiveRecord Project, cont'd


**Gemfile** and **Gemfile.lock**:
--


A Gemfile lists the gems required for the project.
--


 * You can edit your `Gemfile` in order to change the gem-versions your project uses (you can also omit the actual version number and only put in the name of the gem). 
--


   These gems will be installed if you enter `bundle install` (or, by default, `bundle`) at the command line. 
--
**This is normally the first command you use when setting up an ActiveRecord project.**


 * If changing the `Gemfile` doesn't seem to "stick" — if the same old gem-versions still seem to be in use after `bundle install` — **try deleting the `Gemfile.lock`**.
--


 * At the command line: `gem list` will list all gems on system for current Ruby version.
--


 * At the command line: `bundle exec gem list` is the same as `gem list`, but only for the local project.
---

### How Do We Use `rake` to Issue Commands to ActiveRecord?
--

**Create** a database:
--

```ruby
bundle exec rake db:create
```
--


Dev Bootcamp machines have an alias `be` for `bundle exec`.
--


**Perform migrations** (set up and modify the database):
--

```ruby
bundle exec rake db:migrate
```
--


Note that migration files are loaded in sort-order by creation-date, based on the timestamps at the beginning of each filename.
--


"**Seed**" the database with starting data:
--

```ruby
bundle exec rake db:seed
```
---

### How Do We Use `rake` to Issue Commands to ActiveRecord? (…)


**Rollback** (undo) migrations:
--

```ruby
bundle exec rake db:drop
```
--


Rollback doesn't drop (delete) the database; it restores the database to some earlier version, before particular migrations have been run.
--


To **drop**:
--
    
```ruby
bundle exec rake db:drop
```
--


To **open the console**:
--

```ruby
rake console
```
--


You can edit the Rakefile to make your default console be Pry rather than IRB.
--


It is good practice to open the console immediately after creating a table, in order to see whether the corresponding class exists or not, and to test some of the built-in methods. For instance:
--

    
```ruby
Client.create(name: "Pete")
```
---

### Two Other Small Points
--


 1. Persistence vs. objects existing only in memory
--


    * `obj.save` will persist a record modified in Ruby.
--

       Until you persist it, it exists only in memory and you will be unable to find it in the database.
--

    * `obj.create` will create (and thereby persist) a record.
--

 1. For now, at DBC, migration files should contain only a `def change` method; all data-entry will be done using `seed`.
