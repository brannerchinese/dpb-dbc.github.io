## A Common Problem with Arrays

Problem:

```ruby
[1] pry(main)> a = []
=> []
[2] pry(main)> b = a
=> []
[3] pry(main)> a << 5
=> [5]
[4] pry(main)> b
=> [5]
```
--

This happens because `a` and `b` are actually the same array. Change one and you change "both". 
--

(I put both in quotes because there aren't actually two — there's only one.)

---

## A Common Problem with Arrays, cont'd

Solution:

```ruby
[5] pry(main)> c = []
=> []
[6] pry(main)> d = c.dup
=> []
[7] pry(main)> c << 5
=> [5]
[8] pry(main)> d
=> []
```
--

By replicating an array with the method `dup`, we are making `d` totally separate from `c`.
--


But note that this only works for flat arrays. If you have a nested array, you'll have to `dup` each subelement, and so on down to any sub-sub-elements, etc.
--

```ruby
new_array = Array.new
old_array.map {|row| row.dup}
```


---

## Creating Nested Arrays

Here's one way of creating a nested array of certain dimensions:
--

```ruby
[1] pry(main)> rows, cols = 3, 4
=> [3, 4]
[2] pry(main)> a = [[nil] * cols ] * rows
=> [[nil, nil, nil, nil], [nil, nil, nil, nil], [nil, nil, nil, nil]]
``` 
--

Translation (reading from the outside in):
--


 1. create `rows` number of rows
--

 1. each row should consist of a subarray
--

 1. inside each subarray should be `cols` number of `nil`s
--


But look what happens if I try to push something into one sub-array:
--

```ruby
[3] pry(main)> a[0] << 5
=> [nil, nil, nil, nil, 5]
[4] pry(main)> a
=> [[nil, nil, nil, nil, 5], [nil, nil, nil, nil, 5], [nil, nil, nil, nil, 5]]
```
--

It's the same problem — `a[0]` isn't a single sub-array, but _each_ of the four sub-arrays of `a`.

---

## Creating Nested Arrays, cont'd.

Instead, use a more verbose but more explicit way of creating a nested array:
--

```ruby
[1] pry(main)> rows, cols = 3, 4
=> [3, 4]
[2] pry(main)> e = Array.new(rows) { Array.new(cols) }
=> [[nil, nil, nil, nil], [nil, nil, nil, nil], [nil, nil, nil, nil]]
```
--

Translation:
--

 1. create an array with `rows` number of rows
--

 1. inside each row, create a new (distinct) array with `cols` number of columns
--


And now push something into a sub-array:
--

```ruby
[3] pry(main)> e[0] << 5
=> [nil, nil, nil, nil, 5]
[4] pry(main)> e
=> [[nil, nil, nil, nil, 5], [nil, nil, nil, nil], [nil, nil, nil, nil]]
```
--

_This_ behaves as we expected.
--

---

## Creating Nested Arrays, cont'd.

One more question: 
--

How can we tell whether an array was created one way or the other?
--


We can't. We have to read the code and find out, or else do experiments.

---

## Does a Nested Array Contain a Certain Element?
--


If an array is nested, in order to find out if it contains a certain element, ask yourself: 
--

**Do I mean a certain element? or a certain subelement?**
--

```ruby
[1] pry(main)> b = (0..11).to_a.each_slice(rows).map {|row| row}
=> [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11]]
```
--

Array `b` contains element `[0, 1, 2]`, but not _sub_-element `0`.
--

```ruby
[2] pry(main)> b.include?(0)
=> false
[3] pry(main)> b.include?([0, 1, 2])
=> true
```

You could ask: does subarray `b[0]` contain element (subelement of `a`) `0`?
--

```ruby
[4] pry(main)> b[0].include?(0)
=> true
```
--

In other words, look for it in exactly the place you'd expect to find it — which in this case is not the top-level elements of the array.

---

## Does a Nested Array Contain a Certain Element?, cont'd.

Other approaches:
--


 1. Flatten the list and look for your item there:

```ruby
[1] pry(main)> b.flatten
=> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
[2] pry(main)> b.flatten.include?(0)
=> true
[3] pry(main)> c = b.flatten
=> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
[4] pry(main)> c.include?(0)
=> true
```
--


A problem: flattening a list means going through the whole list, which is a linear-time, O(n), operation.
--


Also, in order to use this flattened array `c`, you have to hold onto it for the long term, and keep it current with any changes in `b`.
--


That seems like a recipe for confusion and error.

---

## Does a Nested Array Contain a Certain Element?, cont'd.

Other approaches, cont'd:
--


 2. Return any element containing the subelement you want:
--

```ruby
[1] pry(main)> b.select {|subarray| subarray.include?(0)}
=> [[0, 1, 2]]
``` 
--

What is the time-complexity? `select` has linear time-complexity, because you have to traverse each element. 
--

There are four elements in `b`. 
--

Then you have to traverse each subelement of each subarray — that's three subelements apiece, or 12 in all. 
--

In other words, the time-complexity is also O(n).
--


 3. You can use `any?` to answer `true` or `false`
--

, instead of returning a subarray:
--

```ruby
[2] pry(main)> b.select {|subarray| subarray.include?(0)}.any?
=> true
```
--

If you do, the search will stop as soon as the first case of `subarray.include?(0)` returns true. 
--

Method `any?` is said to "short-circuit" the traversal of an array. 
--

It wants to be able to answer `true` as soon as it knows it can, and then stop. 
--

Only if the answer is `false` does it have to traverse the whole array.

---

## Rotating ("Transposing") an Array
--


In case you ever want to rotate an array:
--

```ruby
[1] pry(main)> b = (0..11).to_a.each_slice(rows).map {|row| row}
=> [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11]]
[2] pry(main)> b.transpose
=> [[0, 3, 6, 9], [1, 4, 7, 10], [2, 5, 8, 11]]
``` 
--


Or, to see the rows _printed_ more like actual rows:
--

```ruby
[3] pry(main)> b.transpose.each {|row| p row}
[0, 3, 6, 9]
[1, 4, 7, 10]
[2, 5, 8, 11]
=> [[0, 3, 6, 9], [1, 4, 7, 10], [2, 5, 8, 11]]
```
--

The return value is still the same array, regardless of how you print it.
